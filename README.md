# learn-nn-by-quiz

    An easy & practical course on neural network basics for the real newbies.
    Life is short, we use pytorch :)

----

Here I'll give a list of quizzes guiding to learn the [neural network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_network) basics, mostly for you the non-academical apprentices :)

❌ I will not teach by directly providing the knowlege, conclusion, formula or cheat sheet to memorize.  
✅ I will show you the related materials and give few questions; it is you that should investigate all by yourself to understand them, then answer the questions.  

👉 Let's go~ 🎉
